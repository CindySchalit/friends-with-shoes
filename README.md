Friends with Shoes

Friends with Shoes is intended to be a web application for people who have feet of different sizes. For such persons, shoe shopping can be a hassle because they typically have to buy two pairs of the same shoe.

For instance, someone with a left foot of size 10 and a right foot of size 12 must buy two pairs of shoes - one of size 10 and another of size 12 - leaving him or her with an extra right shoe (size 12) and left shoe (size 10).

Friends with Shoes is a marketplace where the reciprocally lopsided can exchange these extra shoes.
